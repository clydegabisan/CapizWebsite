                        <p>The whitewashed museum was originally built as a water tank on 1910, through the efforts of
                            President Pastor Alcasar, the third President of the town of Capiz (1908-1912), to provide water
                            to the local residents during the dry season. It was constructed near the “municipio.” The water
                            flowed from the roof of the two-storey municipal building to the water tank which was 11.5 meter
                            in diameter and 6.10 meters in height, with walls that are 11 inches thick. It was luckily
                            spared from the devastation of World War II because of its strong framework.</p>
    
                        <p>After the war, offices were built around the tank completely hiding it from view with only a
                            water spout visible. In 1993, the offices were demolished and for the first time in three
                            decades, the water tank was seen again.</p>
    
                        <p>"Panublion", a Hiligaynon term which means "heritage", is the official name of the museum. Over
                            the years, it has outlived its purpose since the town came up with a modern water system. Thus,
                            the birth of the Panublion Museum by Mayor Juliano Alba in the year 1992. It was named Panublion
                            since it is considered as a gift from the past.</p>
    
                        <p>The Panublion Museum features the memorabilia of the prominent sons and daughters of the Province
                            of Capiz and collections of religious and cultural icons, artifacts and artworks.</p>

                            classic European architectural design. Connecting the commercial center of the city to the main

                            ushered in progress and development in the city. Like the old bridge, equally alluring is the

                            two-story government-owned wooden house that was destroyed by a typhoon. Under the American

                            the façade of the building which can be seen to this day, was set to symbolize the influence of
                            the United States in Capiz.</p>
    
                        <p>Under Gov. Jose Borda in 1989, the Provincial Capitol was remodeled. The Governor’s Hall had
                            major renovation and the windows were decorated with pios or Capiz shells that gave the building
                            a grander look.</p>

                        <p>Founded in 1707 by Augustinian missionaries, the Immaculate Conception Metropolitan Cathedral is
                            one of the oldest churches in the Panay Island.</p>
    
                        <p>The church is standing in the heart of Roxas City facing the Panay River and the old Capiz
                            Bridge; and is celebrated for standing the test of weather and time. Not only it has served as a
                            place of worship for more than 300 years, but it has also become a destination for pilgrimage
                            experience and faith-based tourism in the province.</p>
    
                        <p>This church was built with hardwood and bamboos before 1698. However, a strong typhoon on January
                            4, 1698 destroyed it and the convent. The stone church was then constructed from 1728 to 1732
                            but in the unfortunate year of 1787, it was destroyed by an earthquake.</p>
    
                        <p>From 1870 to 1885, it was rebuilt with stone and galvanized iron through the efforts of Fr.
                            Apolinar Alvarez, O.S.A. And on the succeeding years, from 1885 to 1890, Fr. Lesmes Perez,
                            O.S.A. made restorations by installing the ceiling with galvanized iron and plastering the walls
                            with stucco and adding three grandiose altars.</p>
    
                        <p>This church was also considered as one of the most beautiful churches in the Philippines.</p>

                        <p>From being a home school, Filamer Christian University celebrates more than 100 years of
                            Christian Education. It was founded in 1904 by Rev. Joseph Robbins and his wife, Cecilia Sainz,
                            as a primary school for orphaned and homeless children. During the wage of the Second World War,
                            Filamer closed and was used as garrison by the Japanese soldiers. When the civil government
                            reconstituted after the war, the school reopened with a secondary level under the directory of
                            the first Filipino principal, Jacoba Ibañez. In 1952, it was named Filamer Christian Institute,
                            signifying the ties between the Filipinos and the Americans working together to run the
                            institute. In 1985, it was officially named as Filamer Christian College. By July of 2010, it
                            was granted the university status, thus named, Filamer Christian University.</p>

                            bells. Popularly known as the Panay Bell, it is cast from 70 sacks of coins contributed by the

                        <p>This century-old Church’s interior is shaped like a cross and is made from yellow sandstone. The
                            Church’s six arched windows at each side with columns between them reaching the roof with
                            buttresses at the side give it a different look.&nbsp; It was finished in 1873 when Fr. Angel
                            Abasolo was the parish priest of the town.&nbsp; At the front left side of the church is the
                            five-storey belfry housing five bells of different sizes, all made in 1881.</p>
    
                        <p>Other historical accounts also point to an earlier construction of the church. According to Henry
                            Florida Funtecha, a historian from Barangay Duran, the first church and convent were constructed
                            between 1600 and 1720. Under the leadership of Padre Agustin Duran in 1833, the church was
                            constructed with yellow sandstone and its interior walls were decorated with Padre Juan Carlos’
                            paintings. This corroborated with Fr. Pedro G. Galende’s account in his book Angels in Stone:
                            Augustinian Churches in the Philippines about the possibility that it was Padre Angel Abasolo
                            who initiated the construction of the church, and having it rebuilt from a previous structure.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>On January 10, 1875, the church was destroyed by a typhoon. In 1948, a strong earthquake heavily
                            damaged the church and other structures in the town. Only the church’s walls and the belfry were
                            left standing. A temporary church was built in front of the present structure until it was
                            reconstructed in the 1950’s under Monsignor Jesus N. Frantilla as parish priest.</p>

                        <p>Balisong Hill, also known as the Calupugan Hill, is a sloping hill in the barangay of San Esteban
                            in Pilar Capiz surrounded by caves, fishponds and mangroves. It was named after the Balisong
                            River which once flowed at the foot of the hill.&nbsp;</p>
    
                        <p>The Balisong Hill served as a silent witness to a battle between the Spanish soldiers and the
                            Filipino revolutionaries known in history as the Battle of Balisong. It was chosen by the
                            revolutionary leaders as the site of their camp not only because it was a strategic location but
                            that the surrounding provided a good source of food, water and big rocks that supplemented their
                            meager ammunition.&nbsp;</p>
    
                        <p>The Battle of Balisong began when Juan Arce, the revolutionary organizer in the area of Sara,
                            Iloilo; Pilar, Cuartero, Dao and Pan-ay, was informed by his messenger of the arrival of the
                            Spanish warship of 500 cazadores led by Capiz Gov. Juan Herrero. Upon Herrero’s order, the first
                            group of cazadores moved forward and started the attack. When they were close enough, Juan Arce
                            signaled to return fire. The Spaniards were better armed and had outnumbered the revolutionaries
                            by 20 to 1. When they ran out of ammunition, they threw stones at their enemies causing minimal
                            damage. Then they cut the anchoring vines of the 3-meter-long logs that they positioned on the
                            summit of the hill, and rolled them to the cazadores. After three hours of intense fighting,
                            Arce’s gun was hit by a bullet from the Spanish troops and bounced to his forehead. Before he
                            died, he ordered Dalmacio Patricio, his right hand man to escape.</p>
    
                        <p>The revolutionaries lost Arce and Jorge Sinson, while the Spanish troops lost nearly 200
                            soldiers.</p>
