                            preservation of our mangroves and river systems. Floating cabanas used for rent and used for
                            tours, come in different sizes with different holding capacity. Now, the ecopark has become an
                            educational recreation facility and a venue for community participation in rehabilitating the
                            river and the mangrove ecosystem.</p>

                            There is a small chapel near the falls where mass can be heard. The area is also open to those
                            who would like to conduct retreats by appointment. Hinulugan Falls serves as a water source of
                            the community surrounding the falls and is considered as one of the major tourist attractions in
                            the province of Capiz. According to tales passed from one generation to the next, there was a
                            hunter who happened to chase after a deer in the forest. Not knowing that there was a waterfall
                            ahead of him, he fell off the edge and into the waters. Thus, it was named Hinulugan.</p>

                        <p>Liktinon falls is a natural-layered waterfall located within the protected forest areas of
                            Barangay Bayuyan, President Roxas, Capiz. It has two known levels. The first level is 8 to 9
                            feet tall and is inclined or sloped. The swimming area spans 40 to 60 meters and has a depth of
                            13 to 16 feet. The water is cool and clear since the base of the area is filled with rocks. The
                            surrounding forest area adds serenity and relaxation to those who swim. A few hiking steps above
                            the first level is the second level which is taller at about 11 to 14 feet tall. Because of the
                            difficulty in climbing, the second level is seldom visited. The trek going up to Liktinon falls
                            is an adventure itself since you have to endure jumping from one boulder to another before
                            reaching the falls and the swimming area.</p>
    
                        <p>The locals named the place to describe the process in going up to the waterfalls which is, “naga
                            liktin-liktin” or to jump from one place to another hence, “Liktinon”.</p>

                            tourists. It is an eco-tourism site that is also a livelihood source for the people of Barangay

                        <p>Located just 300 meters away from the provincial road, the Suhot Cave and Spring in Dumalag,
                            Capiz is a series of interconnected caverns of different sizes with a pool of clear ice-cold
                            water fed by a rock spring from within the cave. Suhot is believed to have a connecting tunnel
                            to the Badiang Cave in Dumarao since both caves are found in the same mountain and are only 6
                            kilometers apart.</p>
